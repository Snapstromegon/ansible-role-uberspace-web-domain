# Ansible Role: uberspace-web-domain

This is part of the uberspace roles collection.

This is meant to be used on your [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de/).

Please be aware, that I'm neither part of the Uberspace team, nor am I associated to them other than having some Uberspaces myself.
This project was created, because I wanted to use the roles for myself and thought they were okay-ish enough to share them.

## What is this (from the uberspace manual)

Every Uberspace account gets its own domain in the form of \$USER.uber.space. You can setup as many additional domains as you like.

You can find the documentation of the replaced tool `uberspace web domain` in the Uberspace Manual [here](https://manual.uberspace.de/web-domains.html).
